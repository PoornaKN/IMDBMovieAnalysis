# IMDB-Movie-Analysis

# Background 
There’s a joke in Hollywood where they say, “How do you market a movie?” And all the studio executives get on a rooftop and scream, “Come see my movie!”. However, this is no longer the trend. Movie industry and associated tech-giants who run movie-business models want to explore data to emerge into new markets, amplify sales and penetrate the market.
The entertainment industry is an inherently costly endeavor and capturing the attention and hard-earned money of consumers requires a significant financial commitment. Spending more than your competitors doesn’t necessarily guarantee victory. But it certainly isn’t an impediment to progress. The budgets allocated by Netflix and Amazon for purchasing license rights for movies are mentioned below.
Netflix: $17 Billion, Amazon Prime Video: $9 Billion
As business analysts, we aim to cite recommendations and proposals based on data to tech-giants regarding the factors to be considered by content platforms/production companies prior to acquiring license for a specific content for them to maximize profitability.
